\chapter{Introduction}
In this part, we are going to present the fundamental knowledge
which is composed into the base for the quantum chemistry.

Here, what kind of criteria about "essence knowledge" we choose to
organize this part? After long time of deliberation, I believe that
such criteria should be derived from the point that the chosen
knowledge should be fundamental enough that they are repeatedly
discussed, learned even decades of years gone away; but the main
framework and expressions is still retained and any of new research
production is continuously growing from that base. These knowledge
should be like the stem and root of the tree for the quantum
chemistry, they are the headstream of the new knowledge and skills,
as the climber of this area is going to explore some new skills; he
should turn back to see its bottom to check whether there's enough
solid ground base to support the new constructions.

\textbf{Root}, which is what I wish to call these knowledge, and
that is really what I want to present in this part. Hopes that I
can.
