Nov 10th, 2011:
ported into Google project for a new hosting. right now just write
down the future plan for this folder:
1  HF and DFT:
   The basic framework has been done. However, it's better to 
   check the documents again, and the revise them.
2  DFT functionals:
   we already have something inside. Check it, and begin the 
   advanced topic on this part.
3  post HF method:
   so far only CI is little discussed, in the future we need:
   3.1  General CI discussion;
   3.2  MCSCF;
   3.3  Couple Cluster
4  based on the post HF method and DFT functionals, we need a more
   clear concept about the "correlation", inclduing both non-dynamic
   one and dynamic correlations.

work has been done: 
   derivatives related documents finally moved to algorithm part
   (HF, DFT etc.)
   DFT grid, TDDFT gradient and functional derivatives etc. all 
   moved to algorithm folder
